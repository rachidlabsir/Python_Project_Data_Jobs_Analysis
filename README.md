# Overview
Welcome to my analysis of the data job market, specifically focusing on data analyst roles. This project aims to provide a clearer understanding of the current job landscape, highlighting top-paying positions and in-demand skills. By delving into these areas, I hope to help data analysts identify the most promising job opportunities and navigate the market more effectively.

The data for this analysis is sourced from [Luke Barousse's webiste](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lukebarousse/data_jobs), which offers a comprehensive foundation, including detailed information on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. Using a series of Python scripts, I examine critical questions such as the most sought-after skills, salary trends, and the relationship between demand and salary in the field of data analytics.

# The Questions
In this project, I aim to address the following key questions:

    1-What are the most in-demand skills for the top three most popular data roles?
    2-How are in-demand skills evolving for Data Analysts?
    3-How do salaries and job opportunities correlate with skills for Data Analysts?
    4-What are the optimal skills for Data Analysts to acquire in terms of both high demand and high pay?

# Tools I Used

Python: The core of my analysis, enabling me to extract critical insights from the data. Key Python libraries used include:

    Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    Matplotlib: For creating basic data visualizations.
    Seaborn: For generating more advanced and aesthetically pleasing visuals.

Jupyter Notebooks: The platform I used to run Python scripts, which allowed me to seamlessly integrate notes and analysis.
Visual Studio Code: My preferred editor for executing Python scripts.
Git & GitHub: Essential tools for version control, project tracking, and collaboration, ensuring efficient code management and sharing.
# Import & Clean Up Data

I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.
```python
# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```

# Filter US Jobs
To focus my analysis on the U.S. job market, I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in the United States.
```python
df_US = df[df['job_country'] == 'United States']
```
# The Analysis

Each Jupyter Notebook in this project was designed to investigate specific aspects of the data job market. Hereâ€™s how I 
approached each question:

## 1-What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To determine the most demanded skills for the top 3 data roles, I first identified the most popular positions. Then, I extracted the top 5 skills associated with each of these roles. This analysis highlights the key skills for the most sought-after job titles, helping me focus on the skills that are crucial for the roles I am targeting.

### Visualize Data
```python


fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles),1)
sns.set_theme(style = 'ticks')
for i ,job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
   df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
   sns.barplot(data = df_plot , x='skills_perc',y='job_skills',hue = 'job_skills' ,ax = ax[i], palette = 'dark:b_r') 
   ax[i].set_title(job_title)
   ax[i].set_ylabel('')
   ax[i].set_xlabel('')
   ax[i].set_xlim(0, 78)
   if i == len(job_titles) -1:
     ax[i].set_xticks([])   
    
   for n, v in enumerate(df_plot['skills_perc']):
        ax[i].text(v + 1, n, f'{v:.0f}%', va='center')

## 3-How do salaries and job opportunities correlate with skills for Data Analysts?
To identify the highest-paying roles and skills, I focused on job postings in the United States and analyzed their median salaries. Initially, I examined the salary distributions for common data roles such as Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst to determine which positions command the highest pay.

You can view the detailed analysis in my notebook here: [4_Salary_Analysis](https://github.com/rachidlabsir/project_data_jobs_analysis/blob/main/4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb)

### Visualize Data:
```python


sns.boxplot(data=df_US_top6, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short', order=job_order)
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
sns.despine()

# this is all the same
plt.title('Salary Distributions of Data Jobs in the US')
plt.xlabel('Yearly Salary (USD)')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.xlim(0, 600000) 
ticks_x = plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K')
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(ticks_x)
plt.show()
```

## Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analysts
Next, I narrowed my analysis and focused only on data analyst roles. I looked at the highest-paid skills and the most in-demand skills. I used two bar charts to showcase these.
### Visualize Data
```python

fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1)  

# Top 10 Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_top_pay, x='median', y=df_DA_top_pay.index, hue='median', ax=ax[0], palette='dark:b_r')
ax[0].legend().remove()
# original code:
# df_DA_top_pay[::-1].plot(kind='barh', y='median', ax=ax[0], legend=False) 
ax[0].set_title('Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts in the US')
ax[0].set_ylabel('')
ax[0].set_xlabel('')
ax[0].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))


# Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts')
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_skills, x='median', y=df_DA_skills.index, hue='median', ax=ax[1], palette='light:b')
ax[1].legend().remove()
# original code:
# df_DA_skills[::-1].plot(kind='barh', y='median', ax=ax[1], legend=False)
ax[1].set_title('Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts in the US')
ax[1].set_ylabel('')
ax[1].set_xlabel('Median Salary (USD)')
ax[1].set_xlim(ax[0].get_xlim())  # Set the same x-axis limits as the first plot
ax[1].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))

sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
Here's the breakdown of the highest-paid & most in-demand skills for data analysts in the US:

##  4-What are the optimal skills for Data Analysts to acquire in terms of both high demand and high pay?
To identify the most optimal skills to learnâ€”those that are both the highest paid and most in demandâ€”I calculated the percentage of demand and the median salary for these skills. This analysis helps pinpoint which skills offer the best balance of compensation and job market relevance.

You can view the detailed steps in my notebook here: [5_Optimal_Skills](https://github.com/rachidlabsir/project_data_jobs_analysis/blob/main/5_Optimal_Skills.ipynb)

### Visualize Data:
```python

from adjustText import adjust_text

plt.scatter(df_DA_skills_high_demand['skill_percent'], df_DA_skills_high_demand['median_salary'])
plt.xlabel('Percent of Data Analyst Jobs')
plt.ylabel('Median Salary ($USD)')  # Assuming this is the label you want for y-axis
plt.title('Most Optimal Skills for Data Analysts in the US')

# Get current axes, set limits, and format axes
ax = plt.gca()
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K'))  # Example formatting y-axis

# Add labels to points and collect them in a list
texts = []
for i, txt in enumerate(df_DA_skills_high_demand.index):
    texts.append(plt.text(df_DA_skills_high_demand['skill_percent'].iloc[i], df_DA_skills_high_demand['median_salary'].iloc[i], " " + txt))

# Adjust text to avoid overlap and add arrows
adjust_text(texts, arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', color='gray'))

plt.show()
```
